				<h1 class="modal-title">1 – Establish geographical scope and timeframe</h1> 
				<p>The first step establishes the geographical scope/area and timeframe for the Programme Criticality assessment.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The geographical scope/area of a Programme Criticality assessment should be the same as the geographical area of coverage in the SRM, where possible, since this will make it easier to compare the result of the assessment to the present security risk in that area. Any differences in the areas should be noted and changes to either the PC area or SRM area should be reflected in the next regular Programme Criticality assessment.</li>
						<li>If the portfolio of United Nations outputs varies considerably between different geographic areas in a given country, then separate Programme Criticality assessments should be carried out for these areas.</li>
						<li>A Programme Criticality assessment can be valid for up to 12 months before it must be reviewed and possibly revised. If the operating environment and programmatic context are volatile and fast-changing, then a shorter timeframe for the Programme Criticality assessment should be envisaged. Likewise, a shorter timeframe may be warranted for the duration of a special event of country-wide magnitude, for example an election. (see Step 8 below on the review of a Programme Criticality assessment).</li>
						<li>Scope and timeframe must be agreed before the next steps of the Programme Criticality assessment are initiated.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="modal-content step-2-fade"> 
				<a href="#" class="close"></a> 
				<h1 class="modal-title">2 - List strategic results</h1> 
				<p>The second step is to confirm and list the strategic results (SR) that the United Nations will collectively work towards in the geographical area and in the agreed timeframe.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The SR are derived from the various existing planning documents that the United Nations system uses, such as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), the Integrated Strategic Framework (ISF), the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) or other strategic planning documents. The methodology allows for entering up to six (6) SR by geographical area.</li>
						<li> It is of critical importance that the set of agreed strategic results reflects an accurate balance of the United Nations’ collective priorities for the geographic area and specified timeframe.</li>
						<li>Additional, situation-specific SRs may be devised in certain situations that are of high importance for the timeframe of the assessment which are not captured in multi-year plans, such as upcoming elections or peace negotiations. Such a Strategic Result could capture, for example, the United Nations’ short term measures for support to the local population and actors.</li>
						<li>In order to allow for a smooth assessment process, SR should be formulated clearly and concisely. Results should be described in ‘change’ language, which describes a change in the situation of an affected population, the performance of a service, the allocation of national resources, the existence of needed policies or any other observable change.</li>

				<h1 class="modal-title">3 - List outputs involving United Nations personnel</h1> 
				<p>The third step is to enter a list of all the outputs the United Nations system wishes to implement in the said geographical area and timeframe, using United Nations personnel.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Outputs are, in most cases, an aggregate of individual activities by one or several United Nations entities. It is strongly recommended that the United Nations team in country ensures a consistent listing at output level.15 Supplementary guidance is available from the PC Secretariat on how to best develop a list of outputs for the purposes of a Programme Criticality assessment.</li>
						<li>To ensure consistent rating in a Programme Criticality assessment, similar and overlapping outputs carried out by separate United Nations entities should, wherever possible, be consolidated into joint outputs.</li>
						<li>If the outputs do not require the presence of United Nations personnel to be implemented, they fall outside the scope of a Programme Criticality assessment and should not be listed.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="modal-content step-4-fade"> 
				<a href="#" class="close"></a> 
				<h1 class="modal-title">4 - Assess contribution to strategic results</h1> 
				<p>The fourth step, undertaken in peer review format, is to assess how each of the outputs contributes to each of the strategic results.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>This assessment is on a 0-5 scale. Final agreement on the rating scale is at the discretion of the United Nations country presence.</li>
						<li>The scores for an output’s contribution to each strategic result are averaged in the Excel-based tool to get a score for that output’s total contribution to all the strategic results.</li>
						<li>It is critical that this step is undertaken by working groups representing a cross-section of the United Nations country presence to ensure peer review. The scoring is relative, and without having a common understanding among United Nations entities of the scoring level, comparison becomes futile.</li>
						<li>Before embarking on scoring all activities, a number of outputs should be jointly rated in plenary by the peer review group to set benchmarks for the scoring and establish a common understanding.</li>
						<li>“Enablers” and support outputs: It is advisable that the United Nations country presence jointly agrees on how to score outputs that can be termed as ‘enablers’ to programme and mandate implementation, such as: Coordination and assessments, management, logistics, common services, operations support, etc. It is permissible that the criticality rating of such an enabler remains open in order to be linked, on a case by case basis, to the PC score of the respective programme or mandate outputs that they support.</li>
						<li>While rating the outputs, the agreed timeframe and geographic scope should always be kept in consideration as critical factors: What is the contribution of this output to the SRs during the timeframe and in the geographic area of this assessment?</li>
						<li>The Framework does not consider United Nations outputs implemented by third parties (government, I/NGOs, private sector, third party-contractors, etc.) as long as such activities do not require the physical presence of United Nations personnel. However, even if temporary exposure of United Nations personnel to high or very high risk is being considered, for example through sporadic in-person monitoring visits, then a Programme Criticality rating is required for the given output.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="modal-content step-5-fade"> 
				<a href="#" class="close"></a> 
				<h1 class="modal-title">5 - Assess likelihood of implementation</h1> 
				<p>The fifth step requires the assessment of each output according to its likelihood of implementation within the timeframe of the assessment and in its geographic area.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>This assessment is conducted using a 1-5 scale identical to the likelihood scale used in the Security Risk Assessment (1: very unlikely, 2: unlikely, 3: moderately likely, 4: likely and 5: very likely).</li>
						<li>What is being assessed is whether the resources and capacity are available to implement the outputs listed in the established timeframe. It is not assessing whether the activities themselves will be successful or completed. The question ‘how do you know you can do this?’ is a useful pointer in this step.</li>
						<li>It is suggested that the assessment should be guided by such variables as acceptance (government, local community), capacity and availability of personnel, partner implementing capacity, availability of funding, logistics, physical access (roads, air strips, seasonal climatic conditions, etc.).</li>
						<li>This step is meant to provide a critical reality check of the ability to implement. United Nations entities should be able to justify the likelihood of implementation, and it is therefore recommended that the criteria used be as verifiable as possible. Past implementation performance and current funding levels may be used as criteria.</li>
						<li>All outputs must be assessed against the same set of variables and these must be agreed ahead of scoring.</li>
						<li>One variable that is not considered in judging likelihood of implementation is the security environment, because this variable is already taken into consideration in the SRM process.</li>
						<p>Following the completion of steps 4 and 5, the Excel-based tool generates preliminary ratings of either PC2, PC3 or PC4 for each assessed output.</p>
					</ul>

			<div class="modal-content step-6-fade"> 
				<a href="#" class="close"></a> 
				<h1 class="modal-title">6 - Evaluate activities with PC1 criteria</h1> 
				<p>The sixth step is to evaluate each output to see if it meets the criteria for PC1.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There are two possible criteria for an output to be considered PC1:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Either the output, and individual activities thereunder, are assessed as lifesaving (humanitarian or non-humanitarian) at scale (defined as any activity to support processes or services, including needs assessments), and would have an immediate and significant impact on mortality; or</li>
							<li>The output or individual activity is directed by, or receives the endorsement of the Secretary-General for this particular situation.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>If an activity meets either of these two criteria, it could be considered a PC1 activity and can be (but does not have to be) conducted in very high present risk, if endorsed by the Executive Head of the United Nations entity / Head of the United Nations department and authorized by the Under-Secretary-General of UNDSS.</li>
						<li>Care should be taken to keep outputs identified as PC1 only to those that as so critical that exposing United Nations personnel to very high risk would be acceptable to United Nations entity Representatives and the SRSG or RC.</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="modal-content step-7-fade"> 
				<a href="#" class="close"></a> 
				<h1 class="modal-title">7 - View Programme Criticality level results, form consensus within the United Nations system and approve final results</h1> 
				<p>The seventh step is to view the PC levels of the various outputs, form consensus within the United Nations country presence that this is the final rating agreed, and finally approve the agreed results.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Once agreed by the programme managers/peer reviewers, the final results must be validated by the United Nations team in country at the level of Country Director and approved by the SRSG/Head of Mission or RC, as applicable.</li>
					<li>In the unlikely event that agreement is not reached at country level, the Programme Criticality Steering Group (PCSG), chaired at ASG level, can intervene to mediate and/or ultimately decide.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="modal-content step-8-fade"> 
				<a href="#" class="close"></a> 
				<h1 class="modal-title">8 - Manage and implement the results of the Programme Criticality assessment</h1> 
				<p>Upon finalization of a Programme Criticality assessment, the SRSG/Head of Mission or RC (as applicable) and the Designated Official should submit the results to the PCSG through the Programme Criticality Secretariat.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The submission should include a brief implementation plan that highlights some of the steps through which the United Nations country leadership intends to promulgate and implement the Programme Criticality assessment results.</li>
					<li>While United Nations teams can tailor the process for implementation according to their contexts, it is generally recommended that a Programme Criticality Custodian Group (PCCG) or similar body be created at country level that regularly reviews the Programme Criticality assessment, carries out minor adjustments or re-ratings where necessary, and advises the United Nations country leadership when a revision of the Programme Criticality assessment is required.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The final step is to apply the results of the Programme Criticality assessment within the relevant SRM processes to determine which programmes and mandated activities can proceed without additional risk management based on an agreed level of acceptable risk. This entails comparing the established PC level for each output to the present risk level, as determined through the SRM process, for each operational area where the output is conducted.22 While this process should be led by the Security Management Team (SMT) and overseen by the DO, it also requires that each United Nations entity individually reviews that its outputs and activities are implemented within levels of acceptable risk. If the security risk to implementing an output is not within acceptable limits, United Nations entities can either implement additional Security Risk Management measures to lower the risk, or employ alternative delivery modalities for this output to ensure that United Nations personnel are not exposed to unacceptable risk.</p>
